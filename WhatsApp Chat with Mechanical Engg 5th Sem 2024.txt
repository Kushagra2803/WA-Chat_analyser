18/02/24, 20:45 - +91 70294 74715: By increasing carbon content hardness increases and brittle property increases so compressive  strength increases but how the tensile strength raises?
18/02/24, 20:47 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: first thing in our consideration: Increase in carbon content in plain carbon steel

18/02/24, 20:50 - +91 70294 74715: Ok sir thank you
18/02/24, 20:53 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: with the increase of carbon content from say 0.1 to 0.9 its tensile strength and hardness increases...the % elongation decreases means its ductility decreases... that is why max. carbon % in steel is 1.5%

জীবনের (প্যারডি ) song  -এর বাহার দিয়ে মোরা রুখবো তাঁকে
জীবনের (প্যারডি ) song  -এর বাহার দিয়ে মোরা রুখবো তাঁকে
 
করোনা নিয়ে আসে যখন দুঃখের কালো বাঁধ 
সেই  কালোর  কালি  দিয়ে  মোরা  লিখি  মজার (প্যারডি) গান 
করোনা নিয়ে আসে যখন দুঃখের কালো বাঁধ 
সেই  কালোর  কালি  দিয়ে  মোরা লিখি  বাঁচার (প্যারডি) গান 

খুশির সাথে খাতা দেখালো পাস তো করা গেলো না  
কিছুতেই পাস তো করা গেলো  না  
লক্ষ্য গেলো অন্য পথে 
Cheap  popularity যে তাই মিললো  না  
 
সরস্বতীর  সেবা  করি।
অন্যান্যরা যে তাই (আমায়) বুঝলো না   
লক্ষ্য গেলো অন্য পথে 
Cheap  popularity যে তাই মিললো  না

30/03/24, 16:16 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: *আমাকে আমার মত টুকতে দাও*
আমি পড়াশুনা একবারে ছেড়েই দিয়েছি  

আমাকে আমার মত টুকতে দাও
আমি পড়াশুনা একবারে ছেড়েই দিয়েছি 
যেটা পড়া ছিলোনা ছিলোনা
সেটা না পড়াই থাক
সব পড়লে ব্যর্থ জীবন

তোমার ওই ক্লাসের ppt- গুলো 
বস্তা পচা কিছু নোটের মত
যদি ভুলে যেতে চাও তবে delete করে দাও
MATLAB -এ হাত রাখবো না-না-না
না-না-না-না, না-না-না-না….

এই বিশ্ব যখন recession -এ জেরবার
তবু MATLAB -এ code লিখছি তার হাত থেকে বাঁচবার
আমি রাখতে চাইনা আর তার
প্রতিদিনের এক্সট্রা ক্লাসের আবদার
তাই চেষ্টা করছি বারবার
বাহানা খোঁজার...
না... না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না…..

তোমার হৃদয়ে আছে স্বপ্ন যত
তাঁরা ছুটছে রাত্রি-দিন নিজের মত
কখনো সময় পেলে একটু ভেবো
Recession – এর  বাজারে আমরা কই

মার্ক্স্  পাওয়ার দৌড়ে  আমি চাইনা জিততে 
যত পুঁথি  গত  বিদ্যের  রেজাল্ট  মার্কশীটে 
আমি তিনটে সেমেস্টারের চাপে ফুরিয়ে গেছি
IT গ্ল্যামারের জগতে ভাসবো
না-না-না
না-না-না-না, না-না-না-না

এই বিশ্ব যখন recession -এ জেরবার
তবু Python -এ  Code লিখছি তার হাত থেকে বাঁচবার
আমি রাখতে চাইনা আর তার
প্রতিদিনের এক্সট্রা ক্লাসের আবদার
তাই চেষ্টা করছি বারবার
বাহানা খোঁজার...
না... না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না না,

কখনও বা Charming, কভু দাও বকুনি ,
কখনও বা স্নেহময় টিচার ... Teacher?
চলে গেলো? যেতে দাও

হয়তো কখনও যদি GF/BF খুইয়ে কেউ 
বুকটাতে অকারণে চোট পায়
Pranayam নামে কেউ ছিলো তার জীবনে 
একটি ক্লাসেই সে যে ভুলে যায়... মাস্টার? 

এমন বন্ধু আর কে আছে তোমার মতো মাস্টার
কখনো ও বা মিত্র কভু তুমি শিক্ষক
কখনও বা স্নেহশীল টিচার ... Teacher?

ছাত্ররা (ছাত্রীরা) আজকাল বলেনা তো Funda দাও 
বলে শুধু marks দাও grade দাও, দাও দাও দিয়ে যাও
ChatGPT -কে প্রিয় ভেবে যতখুশী তার সাথে
হাত খুলে ঠক ঠক করে যাও
খরচা নাই ও মাস্টার !

এমন বন্ধু আর কে আছে তোমার মতো মাস্টার 
কখনও বা charming, কভু দাও বকুনি ,
কখনও বা স্নেহময় টিচার ... Teacher?

কান হলো ঝালাপালা কম মার্ক্স্ পেয়ে (ফেল করে) ছাত্র (ছাত্রী) কাঁদে
শেষ নেই আজ এই কান্নার 
আদর্শের গুনে জানি মাস্টার -এ মনটায়
বাজবেনা কারো কোন হাহাকার
এমন বন্ধু আর কে আছে তোমার মতো মাস্টার 
কখনও বা charming, কভু দাও বকুনি ,
কখনও বা স্নেহময় টিচার ... Teacher?

Meri khali khali si, dil pe reh gayee
Jaise mere sapne bikhar ke
*Jale man aap ka bhi, sessional class me copy-paste dekh ke*
SSR, aap bhi tarse
Meri uri uri si, dil pe reh gayee
Meri uri uri si

Tujhe bin jaane, bin pehchaane
Maine hriday se lagaya
Tujhe bin jaane, bin pehchaane
Maine dil se lagaya
*Par mere respect (सम्मान) ke badle men aap ne*
Mujhko etna *assignment* diya

Jaise lockdown ki rut maine kati
Tadapake aanhen bhar bhar ke
Jale man aap ka bhi, *Lab. Class me copy-paste dekh ke*
SSR, aap bhi tarse
Meri bheegi bheegi si………..

এই যে ক্লাসের এই শেখা
হয়তো ক্লাসেই শেষ হবে
তবুও হৃদয় মোর বলে
সঞ্চয় কিছু যেন রবে 🤔

ক্ষণিকের এই পড়াশোনা
স্মরণে করে যে আনাগোনা
হা হা হাঃ হা হা  হু হু হু হু হু হু 

ক্ষণিকের এই পড়াশোনা
স্মরণে করে যে আনাগোনা

তারই কথায় লাগে যেন হাসি 
মরমের শত অনুরোধে
এই যে ক্লাসের এই শেখা
হয়তো ক্লাসেই শেষ হবে

তবুও হৃদয় মোর ভাবে
এ ক্লাস কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে
হা হা হাঃ হা হা  হু হু হু হু হু হু 
তবুও হৃদয় মোর ভাবে
এ করোনা কোথায় নিয়ে যাবে

Recession -এ  হারায় আমি দিশা
তাই, ভবিষতের আলো জ্বলে নিভে 💡

এই যে ক্লাসের এই শেখা
হয়তো ক্লাসেই শেষ হবে
তবুও হৃদয় মোর বলে
Enjoy কিছু যেন হবে 😆

छात्र कल्याण🙄
23/06/24, 16:57 - Pujak NIT DGP: Sir I think we should consider adding Metarial Science as a Core subject
23/06/24, 16:57 - +91 89278 91782: Yes sir
23/06/24, 16:58 - +91 95084 63264: Yes Sir
23/06/24, 16:58 - +91 89278 91782: And I think there is no need of 'physics of engineering material' in 
Our core subject
23/06/24, 17:04 - +91 95084 63264: I think metrology should be added in manufacturing subject
23/06/24, 17:04 - +91 89729 19733: Not only Fe-C alloys but with other materials also
23/06/24, 17:09 - +91 62948 09495: Sir , I think Hydraulic machines (pumps, fans, compressors) should be taught in 4th sem as a compulsory subject immediately after fluid mechanics which is taught to us in 3rd Sem; rather than  a Depth elective in 7th sem
23/06/24, 17:12 - Suddho NIT DGP: Sir some IoT, robotics courses should be introduced, courses on electric vehicles, and mechatronics into core mechanical and the drafter classes should be replaced with CAD , FEM courses
23/06/24, 17:15 - Pujak NIT DGP: We don't have metrology in our course?🧐
23/06/24, 17:15 - +91 89729 19733: And sir I think Lab classes should be coordinated with theory classes,,, like instead of labs in 4th semester of 3rd sem subjects,,, It's better to co-ordinate them with same semester
23/06/24, 17:42 - imkushagralal77: Sir I think Robotics should be a core subject instead of an elective in 7th sem.

Application of AI/ML should be included wherever  possible in the subjects especially in the design engineering part. 

There should a course on mathematics for mechanical engineers in the 3rd sem.

There is also a need for arranging visits to nearby industries to understand the practical aspects of the subjects.
23/06/24, 18:05 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: Noted with thanks... Looking for few more suggestions... your grade in theory & lab in 4th sem will remain unaffected😜

08/08/24, 17:37 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: A shaft is supported between two bearings 1000 mm apart. A 600 mm diameter pulley of weight 450 N is keyed to the shaft at a distance 300 mm to the right of the left bearing and this drives a pulley directly below it with the help of belt having maximum tension of 2.25 kN. Another pulley 400 mm diameter and weight of 250 N is placed 200 mm to the left of right bearing and is driven with the help of electric motor and belt, which is placed horizontally to the right. The angle of contact for both the pulley is 180 degree and co-efficient of friction is 0.24. Select suitable material for shaft and suitable FOS. (a) Draw the shaft layout, (b) Determine the shaft diameter. The combined shock and fatigue factors for bending and torsion are assumed as 1.5 and 1.1, respectively.

তোমরা যতই তোমরা যতই,
আঘাত করো নেইকো অভিমান,
শুধু আমায় দাওগো সুযোগ,
*শোনাতে এ জ্ঞান*
তোমরা যতই আঘাত করো।

28/08/24, 06:31 - SSR Sir NIT DGP: আমাকে আমার মত টুকতে দাও
আমি পড়াশুনা একবারে ছেড়েই দিয়েছি  

আমাকে আমার মত টুকতে দাও
আমি পড়াশুনা একবারে ছেড়েই দিয়েছি 
যেটা পড়া ছিলোনা ছিলোনা
সেটা না পড়াই থাক
সব পড়লে ব্যর্থ জীবন

তোমার ওই ক্লাসের ppt- গুলো 
বস্তা পচা কিছু নোটের মত
যদি ভুলে যেতে চাও তবে delete করে দাও
Coding (python) -এ হাত রাখবো না-না-না
না-না-না-না, না-না-না-না….

এই বিশ্ব যখন recession -এ জেরবার
তবু CAD -এ model করছি তার হাত থেকে বাঁচবার
আমি রাখতে চাইনা আর তার
*প্রতিসপ্তাহের makeup ক্লাসের আবদার*
তাই চেষ্টা করছি বারবার
বাহানা খোঁজার...
না... না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না…..

তোমার হৃদয়ে আছে স্বপ্ন যত
তাঁরা ছুটছে রাত্রি-দিন নিজের মত
কখনো সময় পেলে একটু ভেবো
Recession – এর  বাজারে আমরা কই

*মার্ক্স্  পাওয়ার দৌড়ে  আমি চাইনা জিততে* 
*যত পুঁথি  গত  বিদ্যের  রেজাল্ট  মার্কশীটে* 
আমি চারটে সেমেস্টারের চাপে ফুরিয়ে গেছি
*Data Analytic – এর  গ্ল্যামারের জগতে ভাসবো*
না-না-না
না-না-না-না, না-না-না-না

এই বিশ্ব যখন recession -এ জেরবার
তবু Python -এ  Code লিখছি তার হাত থেকে বাঁচবার
আমি রাখতে চাইনা আর তার
প্রতিদিনের এক্সট্রা ক্লাসের আবদার
তাই চেষ্টা করছি বারবার
বাহানা খোঁজার...
না... না-না-না-না না,
না-না-না-না না,
